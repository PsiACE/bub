# Bub Framework

Bub it. Build it.

Bub is a batteries-included, hooks-first AI framework.

Kernel responsibilities:

1. load skills
2. run hook pipeline
3. orchestrate envelopes over the bus
4. keep failure boundaries small

Everything else ships as skills and can be replaced by user-provided skills.
